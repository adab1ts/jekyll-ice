# Jekyll-Ice

Opinionated [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) starter, resembling the one
generated by Jekyll itself but with superpowers.  
Created and maintained by Carles Mui√±os and Klaudia Alvarez.  


## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and change into the project's folder. Then run:

```sh
$ bundle
$ bower install
$ npm install
```

Once installed, open `gulp/config.js` and change settings as needed.  


## Running Gulp-Flow

Jekyll-Ice relies on [Gulp-Flow](https://github.com/adab1ts/gulp-flow.git) to help you develop and build your site. Three main tasks are available:

```sh
$ npm run serve
$ npm run build
$ npm run jekyllize
```

- `npm run serve` will generate a development build of the Jekyll site, start a development server and watch for changes.
- `npm run build` will generate an optimized production build of the Jekyll site.
- `npm run jekyllize` will prepare an optimized version of the Jekyll site code.
